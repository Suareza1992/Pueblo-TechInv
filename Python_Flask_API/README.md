To use this Python script, follow the next steps:

1) Make sure you have MySQL-Python connector installed on your machine:

pip3 install mysql-connector-python - For MacOS users.

pip install mysql-connector-python - For Windows users.

2) Create your database. Make sure it contains the ID for the users, their names and their emails. In this case, an example database has been provided.

3) Replace your values in the Python script if needed:

host -> "localhost"
user -> "your_username"
password -> "your_own_password"
database -> "name_your_database"

4) Save your script. This time, I saved it as Interview_Task_3.py.
